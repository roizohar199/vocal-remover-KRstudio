# Audio Separation Studio

A modern web application for separating audio tracks using AI-powered Demucs technology. This application allows you to upload audio files and separate them into 4 individual instrument tracks (vocals, drums, bass, other) with a beautiful, intuitive interface. The "other" track contains guitar and additional instruments.

## Features

- üéµ **Audio Upload**: Support for MP3, WAV, and other audio formats
- üß† **AI Separation**: Powered by Demucs for high-quality 4-stem separation
- üé§ **4 Individual Tracks**: Separate into vocals, drums, bass, and other (containing guitar and additional instruments)
- üéöÔ∏è **Multi-track Playback**: Individual track controls with volume and mute
- üìÅ **Project Management**: Organize and manage your separated tracks
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful dark theme with glass morphism effects
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Audio Separation**: Demucs (Python)
- **File Handling**: Multer, fs-extra
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-like polling

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3.7+** - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip** (Python package manager) - Usually comes with Python
- **FFmpeg** - Required for audio processing - [Download here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

### Windows-Specific Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit recommended)
- **Git Bash** or **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for better compatibility
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (if you encounter compilation errors)
- **FFmpeg for Windows** - Download from [FFmpeg Windows builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) or install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install ffmpeg`

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
./start.sh
```

#### On Windows:
```cmd
start.bat
```

**Windows Notes:**
- The script will automatically check for Node.js and Python
- **FFmpeg must be installed and added to PATH** before running the script
- Two command prompt windows will open (one for server, one for frontend)
- Keep both windows open while using the application
- The script will install all dependencies automatically

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**

2. **Install FFmpeg:**
   - **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg Windows builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) or install via Chocolatey: `choco install ffmpeg`
   - **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
   - **CentOS/RHEL**: `sudo yum install ffmpeg`

3. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run install-demucs
   ```

5. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## Usage

1. **Upload Audio**: Navigate to the Upload page and select an audio file
2. **Name Your Project**: Enter a descriptive name for your project
3. **Wait for Processing**: The AI will separate your audio into 4 individual tracks (vocals, drums, bass, other)
4. **Enjoy Your Tracks**: Use the Studio to play, mix, and download your separated tracks

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following REST API endpoints:

- `POST /api/upload` - Upload audio files
- `POST /api/separate` - Separate audio tracks using Demucs
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get specific project details
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete a project and its files
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Backend server port (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)

### File Limits

- Maximum file size: 100MB
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, etc.
- Output format: MP3 (320kbps)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Demucs not found" error:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   pip install demucs
   ```

2. **Port already in use:**
   - Change the PORT environment variable
   - Or kill the process using the port

3. **Python not found:**
   - Make sure Python 3 is installed and in your PATH
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`

4. **CORS errors:**
   - The server is configured to accept requests from any origin in development
   - For production, configure CORS appropriately

### Windows-Specific Issues

1. **"python is not recognized" error:**
   - Make sure Python is added to your system PATH
   - Try running `python --version` in a new command prompt
   - Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **"node is not recognized" error:**
   - Make sure Node.js is added to your system PATH
   - Try running `node --version` in a new command prompt
   - Reinstall Node.js and ensure it's added to PATH

3. **"ffmpeg is not recognized" error:**
   - Download FFmpeg from [FFmpeg Windows builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
   - Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
   - Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH
   - Or install via Chocolatey: `choco install ffmpeg`
   - Restart command prompt after adding to PATH

4. **Permission errors:**
   - Run Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Or use Git Bash for better Unix-like environment

5. **Slow performance:**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
   - Use SSD storage for better I/O performance

6. **Command prompt windows closing immediately:**
   - The start.bat script opens separate windows for server and frontend
   - Keep both windows open while using the application
   - If windows close, check the error messages and restart

### Performance Tips

- Use shorter audio files for faster processing
- Close other applications to free up system resources
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for temporary files
- **Windows**: Use SSD storage and ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.
